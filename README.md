# myCloud: HTML and CSS first practice for students

## Context

As a front-end developer, you received [this mockup](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Twikito/myCloud/mockup.png) from the designer, without any additional information. This often happens.

All you know is that your page needs to be optimized for SEO and mobile display.

## Statement

You'll have to code the page with __HTML and CSS__ according to the state of the art, with __responsive__ adaptations for mobile.

But you can use:
- __no class__,
- __no identifier selector__,
- __no attribute selector__,
- __no image__,
- __no javascript__.

Pay particular attention to __semantics__.

## Resources

__Text__:
- You can find all the [text content here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Twikito/myCloud/text.md).

__Fonts__:
- [`Noto Serif`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif)
- [`Source Sans 3`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3)
- [`Oswald`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald)

__Colors__:
- `#4696D0` blue,
- `#2877B0` dark blue,
- `#F5F5F5` background grey,
- `#333333` text color,
- `#FFC843` orange,
- `#FFA823` dark orange,
- `#B25F03` brown
- `#26EC96` green
- `#18A464` dark green
- `#4C5D55` darker green

__Icons__:
- The icons come from [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com) by [@fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)

## Goal

The main aim of this practice is to force students to take a step back from what they see and __focus on content rather than appearance__. Here, they'll have to use __the right HTML tags for each piece of textual content__, and not according to the browser's default appearance.

They should then use __type selectors only__ to style their page, with pseudo-classes or pseudo-elements if necessary.

Without taking this step back, and using different HTML tags appropriate to the content, completing this exercise is impossibleâ€¦ well, almost.

## Result

Here's an example of the expected result: [twikito.github.io/myCloud/](https://twikito.github.io/myCloud/).

__Don't worry__: this is a deliberately complete and complex interpretation of this exercise, with the intention of demonstrating what can be achieved with CSS only.
