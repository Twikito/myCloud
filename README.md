# myCloud: HTML and CSS first practice for students

## Statement

You'll have to code [this mockup](mockup.png) with __HTML and CSS__ according to the state of the art, with __responsive__ adaptations for mobile.

But you can use:
- __no class__,
- __no identifier selector__,
- __no attribute selector__,
- __no image__,
- __no javascript__.

Pay particular attention to __semantics__.

## What you need to know

__Fonts__:
- `Inter`
- `Source Sans 3`
- `Yanone Kaffeesatz`

__Colors__:
- `#74d0ff` blue,
- `#2ca6e5` dark blue,
- `#f7f7f7` background grey,
- `#6a6a6a` text color,
- `#ffc843` orange,
- `#ffa823` dark orange,
- `#07b66a` green

## Result

Here's an example of the expected result: [twikito.github.io/myCloud/](https://twikito.github.io/myCloud/).

__Don't worry__: this is a deliberately complete and complex interpretation of this exercise, with the intention of demonstrating what can be achieved with CSS only.
