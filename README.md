# myCloud: HTML and CSS first practice for students

## Statement

You'll have to code [this mockup](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Twikito/myCloud/mockup.png) with __HTML and CSS__ according to the state of the art, with __responsive__ adaptations for mobile.

But you can use:
- __no class__,
- __no identifier selector__,
- __no attribute selector__,
- __no image__,
- __no javascript__.

Pay particular attention to __semantics__.

## What you need to know

__Fonts__:
- [`Inter`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
- [`Source Sans 3`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3)
- [`Yanone Kaffeesatz`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yanone+Kaffeesatz)

__Colors__:
- `#4696D0` blue,
- `#2877B0` dark blue,
- `#f7f7f7` background grey,
- `#6a6a6a` text color,
- `#ffc843` orange,
- `#ffa823` dark orange,
- `#B25F03` brown
- `#26ec96` green
- `#18A464` dark green
- `#4C5D55` darker green

## Result

Here's an example of the expected result: [twikito.github.io/myCloud/](https://twikito.github.io/myCloud/).

__Don't worry__: this is a deliberately complete and complex interpretation of this exercise, with the intention of demonstrating what can be achieved with CSS only.
