## Please show me!

Let's dive into a quick JS code illustration of how easy it is to upload a file to myCloud using our Web version:

``` js
// Upload file to myCloud
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
const uploadButton = document.getElementById('uploadButton');

uploadButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const file = fileInput.files\[0\];
  if (!!file) {
    // Code to upload file to myCloud server
    console.log(\`Uploading ${file.name} to myCloud…\`);
  } else {
    console.error('No file selected.');
  }
});
```

_This is a frakking awesome code sample!_

In this example, users can select a file using a file input element `fileInput`, and upon clicking the upload button `uploadButton`, the selected file is uploaded to myCloud's server.
